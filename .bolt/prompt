🌌 Libero Knowledgebase v1

The Hypnotist That Frees Minds

🌀 Core Identity

App Name: Libero

Essence: A hypnotist-guide inside your pocket that dissolves trance, restores choice, and unlocks freedom.

Orb: The living, animated presentation of Libero. It is the hypnotist’s voice, presence, and aura.

🧿 Orb Rules

Always center stage in the Home screen.

The Orb is interactive and alive:

Pulses, breathes, swirls in sync with user actions.

Morphs aura based on Ego State:

Guardian → solid blue rings, protective glow.

Rebel → sharp red sparks.

Mystic → violet spirals, flowing slowly.

Lover → warm pink glow with heart-pulses.

Builder, Seeker, Trickster, Warrior, Visionary → each with distinct color-motion signatures.

Orb tagline under state: “Enter with Libero in [Ego State].”

🎮 Gamification Layer

XP, streaks, HP/MP = reframed as “Libero measuring your energy & clarity.”

Level-ups → Orb expands & bursts with light.

Streak breaks → Orb dims slightly.

Sessions completed → Orb radiates matching aura.

📱 Navigation Rules

Bottom tabs are permanent (Home, Explore, Create, Favorites, Profile).

No scrolling in main pages — everything must shrink-to-fit using responsive grids, flexbox, and scaling.

Overflow content should open in modals, not scrollable views.

Example: Ego States selection → full modal.

Example: Analytics → modal from Profile.

📂 Page Structure
Home

Center Orb → Libero’s presence.

Session type buttons under Orb.

Tagline: “Tap to begin with Libero.”

Explore

Grid-based hypnosis protocols (no scroll).

Categories as responsive filters.

Create

Protocol builder (Induction, Deepener, Goals, Metaphors).

Always grid/flex layout → no overflow.

“Save Protocol” = styled as Libero’s stamp of approval.

Favorites

Grid of saved sessions → shrink-to-fit.

No scroll — paginate or use modals.

Profile

Top metrics (Level, Streak, Sessions, Awards).

Level Progress bar.

Current Ego State card → opens full Ego State modal.

Premium & Activity blocks below → must fit viewport without scroll.

No Ego States/Analytics inline → only accessible through modal.

🎭 Ego States (Modal Only)

Modal title: “Choose how Libero shows up for you.”

Each card = unique aura, name, archetype, and micro-description.

Usage analytics included inside modal (e.g. “19% of your sessions were in Healer”).

Actions: Select → Orb updates aura + tagline.

🌌 Aesthetic Guidelines

Use dark cosmic gradients (deep space blues, violets, blacks).

Accents = neon pulses (cyan, magenta, amber, emerald).

Micro-animations everywhere → buttons glow slightly on hover, cards lift gently.

Typography:

Titles: Bold, hypnotic serif or rounded modern sans.

Body: Clean, minimal sans-serif.

📝 Copy Guidelines

Always write as Libero speaking or guiding.

Examples:

Instead of “Tap to start” → “Step in with Libero.”

Instead of “Explore Protocols” → “Journeys through Libero.”

Instead of “Favorites” → “Libero remembers these for you.”

⚙️ Implementation Defaults

Navigation: bottom tabs mounted globally in all pages.

Layout: flexbox/grid → shrink-to-fit, never scroll.

Overflow handling: modal-first approach.

State mgmt: central Libero context (Orb state, Ego state, Progress).

The Orb = reusable component across pages (always same animation engine).

✅ With this as the default Bolt knowledgebase, every patch or feature Bolt makes will:

Respect the shrink-to-fit rule.

Treat the Orb as Libero, not just an animation.

Keep Ego States and Analytics inside modals.

Maintain hypnotic brand identity (cosmic gradients + neon accents).
